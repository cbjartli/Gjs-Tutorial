Gjs/GTK+ 3 Tutorial
===================

This tutorial gives an introduction to writing GTK+ 3 applications with Gjs.

This tutorial presumes some experience with the JavaScript progamming language, 
as well as some knowledge of concepts from object oriented programming. 

Although this tutorial describes the most important classes and methods within
GTK+ 3, it is not supposed to serve as an API reference. Please refer to the
`GTK+ 3 Reference Manual <https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/>`_ for a
detailed description of the API.
